# linear-regression-single-variable
In this project i implemented linear regression with one variable to predict profits for a food truck. Suppose a CEO of a restaurant franchise is considering different cities for opening a new outlet. The chain already has trucks in various cities and you have data for profits and populations from the cities.
 I would like to use this data to help him select which city to expand to next.
The file ex1data1.txt contains the dataset for our linear regression prob- lem. The first column is the population of a city and the second column is the profit of a food truck in that city. A negative value for profit indicates a loss.
